# Privacy Policy for NextinAI
**Last updated:** July 22, 2025

**Who we are**  
NextinAI (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides AI-related news and discussions.

**Information we collect**  
- We do not require accounts and do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from app usage.  
- If you email us, we receive your email address and message to respond to you.  
- We use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for optional push notifications. FCM generates a device token to route notifications to your device.  
- **Local storage:** Bookmarks, muted keywords, and settings are stored **on your device** (SharedPreferences) and are **not uploaded** to our servers.

**How we use information**  
- Device tokens are used only to send notifications you opt into.  
- Support emails are used only to respond to you.

**Third-party services**  
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google)** helps deliver notifications and may receive device information required to operate the service.  
- When you open articles or Reddit posts from the app, you visit third-party sites with their own privacy practices.

**Sharing and selling**  
We do **not** sell personal data. We share data only with service providers operating on our behalf (e.g., Firebase) for the purposes described.

**Retention & your choices**  
- Notification tokens remain active while notifications are enabled. You can disable notifications in device settings or uninstall the app.  
- Support emails are kept as long as needed to address your request; you may ask us to delete them.  
- Local bookmarks/settings remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.

**Children’s privacy**  
The app is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us to request deletion.

**Changes to this policy**  
We may update this policy. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest version.
