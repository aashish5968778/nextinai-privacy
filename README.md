Privacy Policy — NextinAI
Last updated: July 22, 2025

Who we are
NextinAI (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides AI-related news and discussions in a simple mobile app.

Information we collect
• We do not ask you to create an account and we do not collect personally identifiable information.
• If you contact us by email, we receive your email address and any information you include so we can respond to your request.
• The app uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver push notifications. This service creates a device token so notifications can be sent to your device.
• Bookmarks, muted keywords and settings are stored locally on your device using app storage and are not uploaded to our servers.

How we use information
• Device tokens are used only to send push notifications you opt into.
• Support emails are used only to reply to you.

Third-party services
• Firebase Cloud Messaging (by Google) helps deliver notifications and may receive device information necessary to operate the service.
• When you open articles or Reddit posts, you leave our app and visit third-party websites or services that have their own privacy practices.

Sharing and selling
• We do not sell your data.
• We do not share personal information with third parties except service providers that operate strictly on our behalf (for example, Firebase to deliver notifications).

Data retention and choices
• Notification tokens are kept as long as notifications remain enabled or until you uninstall the app.
• You can turn off notifications in your device settings.
• You may request deletion of support emails by contacting us.
• Local bookmarks and settings stay on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.

Children’s privacy
• The app is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from a child, contact us and we will delete it.

Changes to this policy
• We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be revised when changes are made.
