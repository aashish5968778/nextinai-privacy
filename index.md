# Privacy Policy for NextinAI
**Last updated:** July 22, 2025

**Who we are**  
NextinAI (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides AI-related news and discussions.

## Information we collect
- We do not require accounts and do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from app usage.  
- If you email us, we receive your email address and message to respond to you.  
- We use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for optional push notifications (a device token is generated).  
- **Local storage:** bookmarks, muted keywords, and settings are stored **on your device** and are **not uploaded** to our servers.

## How we use information
- Device tokens are used only to send notifications you opt into.  
- Support emails are used only to respond to you.

## Third-party services
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google)** delivers notifications and may process device information needed to operate the service.
- When you open articles or Reddit posts from the app, you visit third-party sites with their own privacy practices.

## Sharing and selling
We do **not** sell personal data. We share data only with service providers operating on our behalf (e.g., Firebase) for the purposes above.

## Retention & your choices
- Notification tokens remain active while notifications are enabled; disable in device settings or uninstall the app to stop.  
- Support emails are kept as long as needed to address your request; you can ask us to delete them.  
- Local bookmarks/settings remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.

## Children’s privacy
The app is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us to request deletion.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy; the “Last updated” date will change when we do.
